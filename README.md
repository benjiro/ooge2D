Rationale
=========
The motivation behind this project is to grasp a understand of the OpenGL API and provide an easy to use game engine based around object-orientated design and standard patterns and idioms which will build a simple and robust framework. Many 2D game engines already exist but most are either blotted or arenâ€™t maintained anymore. My goal is to continue to develop this engine after my project has complete and release it as an open source package so other people can use it for learning purposes and games development.

Requirements
===========
This project requires the following third party libraries to build.
- OpenAL - Sound Library - http://www.openal.org/creative-installers/
- Box2D v2.3.0 - Physics Engine - http://box2d.googlecode.com/svn/tags/v2.3.0
- Freetype 2.5.3 - Font Engine - http://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/freetype2/2.5.3/
- glew 1.10.0 - OpenGL Utilities - https://github.com/nigels-com/glew
- glfw 2.6 - OpenGL Context Manager - http://sourceforge.net/projects/glfw/files/glfw/2.6/
- libsndfile - Sound File Library - http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/
- soil - Image Reading Library - http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html
- xinput - Xbox 360 Controller Library - http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=6812

The visual studio project is setup to look for the libraries in lib/Debug or lib/Release based on the build.
